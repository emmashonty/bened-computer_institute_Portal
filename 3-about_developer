                    I am the son of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Davou Joseph. A student with Federal College of 
                    Education Pankshin, Plateau State of Nigeria. I am studying B.Ed C. in computer 
                    science. My favorite programming language is Visual Basic. How I become 
                    motivated on this language, was because I was been challenge by one ATBU 
                    undergraduate student of 200 level.&nbsp; He made me when I was working on a system 
                    and he asked me whether I can help him with the system so that he make 
                    soomething? I told to him why not? When I gave to him the system, he instantly 
                    maked a game with visual studio and he run the program and told me to click on 
                    the &quot;Play&quot; button. I did as he told me. After playing the game, he told me to 
                    &quot;End&quot; the game I also did as he said. But thewost part of it was when he was 
                    about to leave. I told him to please help me to know how to make this game? and 
                    he said to me that no. He told me that before he teache me how to make this 
                    game, I have to game him N2000, then I told him that I don&#39;t have that amount 
                    righthere if not I would had gave you so that you teache me how to make the 
                    game. And he told me that he is going since am not with the money. I begged him 
                    to please teache me how to make that very game he refused and he left. And then, 
                    he left me with a challenge. I tried to know how to do something like that, but 
                    I could&#39;nt. but I keep on trying untill the time that I started making some 
                    little VB programs. From there, I keep on building from the previous knowledge 
                    and complex idear of programs keep on adding on my previous knowledge. Now 
                    brothers, I can make a reasonable program like this. Now , I have a similar to 
                    the one he refused to teache me. That his game program, now I am loking at it as 
                    a kidz play because I have complexer programs that i made than his game. Press 
                    be to Jesus Christ? and to His Father Almighty God?<br />

                    Their friends/users/everyone, take what ever you are doing very seriously for as 
                    it is written in the Scripture that &quot;no good thing comes easy&quot; and &quot;there is 
                    nothing is impossible with Faith and hard working&quot;. It is the working hard that 
                    enabled me to become how I am now, the level I am now, how far I have reach now 
                    in programming with VB (Visual Basic). There is this wise saying &quot;behind every 
                    succesfull man, there most be a woman&quot; so I too said &quot;behind every successfull 
                    programmer, there most be a working hard&quot;. Thank you for taking your time to 
                    read this my comment. yours sincere Emmanuel Joseph D.</span></td>
